# CPlusPlusPractice
Wanting to refresh my memory, I am creating a place for all of my practice C++ programs.

It is going to resemble my pypractice repo, as I am going to be translating that code to c++ so you can see how Python compares.

##Side Note
I have stumbled across Zed's [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/preface.html) so I will be including his examples in this repo. They will all end in .c .
